# Password-Security

This project is a comprehensive **Password Management and Encryption Toolkit** written in C++. It provides functionalities such as password generation, strength checking, time-to-crack estimation, and implementation of various cryptographic algorithms like Caesar Cipher, Vernam Cipher, XOR Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, Hill Cipher, and RSA encryption.

## Features

1. **Modified Caesar Cipher**
   - Encrypts and decrypts text using a custom alphabet with a configurable shift.

2. **XOR Cipher**
   - Performs XOR-based encryption and decryption using a key.

3. **Vigenère Cipher**
   - Encrypts and decrypts text using a string key.

4. **Password Generator**
   - Generates strong, random passwords with a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.

5. **Password Strength Checker**
   - Evaluates password strength based on length, use of special characters, uppercase letters, and numbers.

6. **Password Crack Time Estimator**
   - Estimates the time required to crack a password using brute force.

7. **Hill Cipher**
   - Encrypts messages using matrix-based encryption (key matrix of user-specified size).

8. **RSA Algorithm**
   - Generates public and private keys, encrypts plaintext, and decrypts ciphertext using the RSA algorithm.

NOTE:This program is designed for Windows systems and may require modifications to run on other operating systems.
